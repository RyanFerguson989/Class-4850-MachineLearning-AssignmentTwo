This PDF should be named LastName_FirstName-Assignment2.PDF\n",

This repository should have a readme file and the Google Colab notebook in it. Note that colab can save a copy directly to GitHub so make sure you test this. Downloading the notebook file and uploading it directly will result in 200 points deduction. The link to your GitHub repository should be included as text/message in the iCollege submission drop, failure to include this link will result in a 100 point penalty. \n",
